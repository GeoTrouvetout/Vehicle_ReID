# Vehicle Re-Identification using CNN Latent Spaces 

This repository is related to the publication "Vehicle Re-Identification using CNN Latent Spaces" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09458). 
The current repository contained the main python applications to reproduce Vehicle Re-identification ranking proposed in this original publication.
